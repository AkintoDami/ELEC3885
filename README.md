# A robust and lightweight helmet-mounted safety camera for cycling
ELEC3885: Group Design Project, group 4 project at the University of Leeds.

The objective of this project is to design and produce a prototype for a camera to mount to the helmet of a cyclist, as well as a software suite for the analysis of footage and user documentation. The camera is intended as a safety device, for example for use in legal proceedings, rather than an 'action cam'. Because of this, it should be low-cost and should not require much effort by the user, for example charging, to use.
